Hi everyone.

This is my first post in this blog. In this blog we solve the CTF Verify of PicoCTF.

So, by the tags we know that we will use forencis and grep. When we start it will give us a command to connect via SSH.

_Verify_

The page gives us the following command to connect via SSH `ssh -p 61677 ctf-player@rhea.picoctf.net`. 

> Just to remember, the option `-p` in ssh it serves to specify the port.
{: .prompt-info }

After execurting the command type the password provided by the website.

_SSH Connection_

Once inside the server run `ls` to list the files in the directory. We see that there is a file called **checksum.txt**, we open it with `cat checksum.txt`.

_Command ls and cat_

It look like a sha256 checksum. Now we entrer in the files directory with `cd files`, we see that have several files, we need to find the file with the same sha256 that is inside **checksum.txt**

_List of files_

To know this we can use the following command:

 ```shell
 sha256sum files/*
 ``` 

However this shows us the checksum of all the files, we need to find the one that matches the known checksum.

_Checksum_

For this we can use **grep**. So, the command would look like this:

 ```shell
 sha256sum files/* | grep checksum
 ```

_Command grep_

Now with the `decrypt.sh` file, we decrypt and get the flag.
